// This is the assembly version.  It is often useful to keep this constant between major releases where the API changes
// since a dll relying on this dll will need to be recompiled if this changes.
// Suggestion: use a version number X.Y.0.0 where X and Y indicate major version numbers.
// [assembly: AssemblyVersion"1.1.3.0")]

// These numbers must be changed whenever a new version of this dll is released, to allow upgrades to proceed correctly.
// Suggestion: Use a version number X.Y.Z.0 where X.Y.Z is the same as the installer version found in common.wxi
